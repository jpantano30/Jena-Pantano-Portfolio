 Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles that were overcome. 
 <ul>
  <li> The images in the carousel are different sizes and I would like to have them all be the same size without having the image being changed.</li>
  <li> One challenge I overcame was formatting the whole website to be responsive especially, the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I changed the pages to use CSS grid and some flexbox. </li>
  <li> The formatting of the carousel was a challenge for me. I had trouble with the placement of the previous and next buttons. </li>
  <li> Challenges with formatting the scoreboard in Tic-Tac-Toe. </li>
 </ul>
