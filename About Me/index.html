            <h2>Educational & Professional Background: </h2>
                <p>I graduated from Boston University with a bachelor of science majoring in health sciences. I left college with a range of knowledge in many areas including personal health, public health, nutrition, fitness and how the body functions. I then studied psychology for a year which helped me improve my emotional intelligence (better understand myself and others) and empathy. After my experience at home during the pandemic, I switched directions and went to culinary school because of my passion for the cooking and pastry arts. I worked as a baker and pastry chef, but ultimately liked working as a cake decorator the most because of the creatively aspect. I want to feel like I am making a positive impact doing something I feel passionate about and that is where software engineering comes in. My journey into the field began when I enrolled in the software engineering program at General Assemblyâ€¦
