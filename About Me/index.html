        <h2>Personal Background: </h2>
            <p> 
                I like to think of myself as a dog and fitness enthusiast. I started CrossFit 5 years ago after many years doing traditional strength training. I started coaching because I wanted to share my knowledge and love for the sport with others. You can find my dog, Paisley, and I at our local CrossFit gym most mornings of the week. 
                <br>
                I got into nutrition in high school after attending a horticultural camp in Hawaii. Ever since then I have been recreating all of my favorte, not so healthy dishes, into nutrious but still delious meals. For example, I made a purple sweet potato crust pizza. Before I went to culinary school, My instagram page was dedicated to healthy recipies. Since graduating, it has transformed into a page filled with dessert. 
                <br> 
                I have always been interested in cooking and baking because of my grandfather who was a professional chef. He cooked for the queen of england and entered competitions where he would create sculptures out of lard. His work and sucess has always been an inspiration to me!
                <br> 
                Before deciding to go to culinary school, I spent a short time studying psychology, taking classes at William James and starting a masters program in clinical mental health counseling at Lesley University. Although, being a liscenced mental health professsional was not for me, I still use the knowledge i've gained in my everyday life. 
                <br> 
                My favorite things to do include CrossFit, cooking, baking, skiing, and traveling around the world.

        <h2>Educational & Professional Background: </h2>
            <p>I graduated from Boston University with a bachelor of science majoring in health sciences. I left college with a range of knowledge in many areas including personal health, public health, nutrition, fitness and how the body functions. I then studied psychology for a year which helped me improve my emotional intelligence (better understand myself and others) and empathy. After my experience at home during the pandemic, I switched directions and went to culinary school because of my passion for cooking and pastry arts. I worked as a baker and pastry chef, but ultimately liked working as a cake decorator the most because of the creatively aspect.

            My main goal in life is to make a positive impact doing something I feel passionate about and that is where software engineering comes in. My journey into the field began when I enrolled in the software engineering program at General Assembly. With my education at general
